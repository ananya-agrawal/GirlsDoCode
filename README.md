# Girls Do Code         

Girls Do Code is the organization created to help newbies to learn more about web development.
# Task 1
## Create a website for yourself and host on github.
#### 1. Download website template
  - Instead of coding from scratch we can use online available html templates.
  - Open google and search for "free html templates"
  - Select the one you like and download it
  - navigate to downloaded file and open it in any text editor you have ( e.g visual studio code, sublime text editor)
  - now you will be able to see website code inside your text editor.
  - navigate to the folder in which your code is present and open the file named index.html. You will now be able to see the website in your web browser.
#### 2. Basic File structure of the code we have
 1. index.html
  this file is the main part of your website and contains the basic code. This files contains things you are able to see on your website.
 2. css
  css is like clothes to your body. the present website you have will also be having some css files in it that gives the website the design (color, transitions etc ).
 3. else everything you don't need to worry about for now.
#### 3. Editing the code
1. open your code in some text editor and navigate to index.html file.
2. the very first thing to try and to get a feel of what the code is all about just try editing some text randomly ( open the webpage in your browser and try to find the words quoted there and edit the same part in your text editor to something else and then just save and relode the webpage. you should be ale to see the change of text on the webpage.
3. so now we are able to edit the content on the webpage to time to proceed further.
4. you are by now able to see some tags( for eg "<title>....</title>", \<a href="..."> sort of things). these are the things which tells the code about what to do with the text mentioned. 
for eg. 
- <title>Hacks</title> means that the webpage title(the name you are able to see in the tab present in your web browser) should be Hacks
- img src="images/undefined.svg" width="50" height="50"> is example of a way to add image in which "images/undefined.svg" is the path to image we want to link and the width and height things denote the width and height of the image respectively.
5. now try changing some images in your webpage. 
  - add the image you want to put in your webpage in the same folder all other images are present in your website code.
  - change the image name in the link mentioned on your index.html and now just save and reload. you should be able to see the image you uploaded.
6. so in this way you ould change text and add and remove images.
7. now all you need to do is play more with your code and allow your imagination to build a website for yourself.
#### 4. remove parts of code
you can remove parts of code in your webpage by commenting it out.
in a code we can write some parts and make them not at all effect code and this is known as comments in code.
so whatever part you are gonna comment out in your code those parts will not at all be visible on your webpage anymore and won't effect your other part of code. and yeah, the best part is you can uncomment them (by removing those extra things got added to comment it) and get them back on your webpage.
1. to remove some section of your webpage all you need to find that section in your code ( it will most probably start with a <division> or <section> tag).
2. now select that entire piece of code ( upto where you want to remove (you will be able to figure out that a block of code generally starts from <div> and ends with </div> i.e basically starts with <...> and ends with </...>))
3. and just comment it out. ( if using visual studio code just select the part of code and press cntrl + / ) 
#### general ways to comment a code 
1. for eg if you want to comment the word "banner"
 all you need to do is add <!-- before banner and --> after it i.e it should look like <!--banner-->
